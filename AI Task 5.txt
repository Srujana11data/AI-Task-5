Developing a complete face detection and recognition application is a substantial project that can't be fully covered in a single response. However, I can provide you with a simplified step-by-step guide and code snippets to get started. This example will use Python, OpenCV for face detection, and a pre-trained model for face recognition. You'll need to further explore and fine-tune your models and expand your application for a production-level system.

Step 1: Installation of Required Libraries

Install the necessary Python libraries:

pip install opencv-python opencv-python-headless numpy

Step 2: Face Detection

Here's a simple example of face detection using OpenCV's Haar Cascade Classifier:
import cv2

# Load the pre-trained Haar Cascade Classifier for face detection
face_cascade = cv2.CascadeClassifier('haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml')

# Initialize the webcam or load a video file
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)  # Use 0 for the default webcam, or specify a video file

while True:
    ret, frame = cap.read()  # Read a frame

    # Convert the frame to grayscale for face detection
    gray = cv2.cvtColor(frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)

    # Perform face detection
    faces = face_cascade.detectMultiScale(gray, scaleFactor=1.3, minNeighbors=5, minSize=(30, 30))

    # Draw rectangles around detected faces
    for (x, y, w, h) in faces:
        cv2.rectangle(frame, (x, y), (x + w, y + h), (0, 255, 0), 2)

    # Display the frame
    cv2.imshow('Face Detection', frame)

    if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
        break

# Release the webcam and close all windows
cap.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()

Step 3: Face Recognition (Optional)

For face recognition, you can use a pre-trained model like FaceNet or VGGFace. Here, we'll use the face_recognition library, which simplifies face recognition:

pip install face_recognition

import cv2
import face_recognition

# Load the known faces and their encodings
known_face_encodings = []
known_face_names = []

# Add known faces and their encodings
# For example:
# known_face_encodings.append(face_encoding_of_person1)
# known_face_names.append("Person 1")

# Initialize the webcam or load a video file
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)  # Use 0 for the default webcam, or specify a video file

while True:
    ret, frame = cap.read()  # Read a frame

    # Find all face locations and encodings in the current frame
    face_locations = face_recognition.face_locations(frame)
    face_encodings = face_recognition.face_encodings(frame, face_locations)

    for (top, right, bottom, left), face_encoding in zip(face_locations, face_encodings):
        # Compare the current face encoding with the known face encodings
        matches = face_recognition.compare_faces(known_face_encodings, face_encoding)

        name = "Unknown"

        if True in matches:
            first_match_index = matches.index(True)
            name = known_face_names[first_match_index]

        # Draw a rectangle and label on the face
        cv2.rectangle(frame, (left, top), (right, bottom), (0, 0, 255), 2)
        cv2.putText(frame, name, (left, top - 10), cv2.FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX, 0.75, (0, 0, 255), 2)

    # Display the frame
    cv2.imshow('Face Recognition', frame)

    if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
        break

# Release the webcam and close all windows
cap.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()


This is a simplified example to get you started. For a production-level system, you would need to collect a larger dataset for recognition, fine-tune the models, handle different scenarios, and build a user-friendly interface. Additionally, consider data privacy and ethical considerations when using facial recognition technology.
